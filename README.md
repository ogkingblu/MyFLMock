# My Florida Website
This website is a revised and improved version of Florida's offical state portal. My team and I were tasked to mock up a better site for the state of Florida, which we created using WordPress; I have included the code for the theme we customized in this repository. My duties on this project included moving the original site into WordPress, designing the layout, implementing plugins, and debugged WordPress issues on our student servers.
